# Independent Research Project: Metabolic Rate Scaling and Kleiber’s Law  
### A Biomedical Engineering–Oriented Quantitative Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents an **independent research investigation** into **metabolic rate scaling** using **Kleiber’s Law**, conducted outside of a formal laboratory or university research group.

The project was **self-designed, self-executed, and independently analyzed**, integrating mathematical modeling, biological theory, and statistical methods to examine how basal metabolic rate (BMR) scales with body mass in both **humans (intraspecies)** and **mammals across species (mouse–human–elephant)**.
